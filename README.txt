There are two python files in total: computational_functions.py and results.py.computational_functions.py contains functions and methods which are also the answers or parts of the answers to question 1a, 1b, 2a, 2c, 3a, 3b and 5b. This file gives no output after running. computational_functions.py needs to be run before using results.py.results.py contains validations of implemented functions and answers or parts of the answers to question to 1a, 1b, 2b, 2d, 2e, 3c, 4a, 4b, 5c, 5d and 5e. It is important to have run the first cell before running any other cell, which imports functions from computational_functions.py and other relevant libraries.For each question, in results.py, it is important to run in the order of cells. For example, one needs to run ‘Question 1a’ before running ‘Question 1b’. After a graph is displayed, it is important that this graph is closed before displaying the next graph, to avoiding overplotting. To run the validations, it is also required to run all the cells before in the same question.
