## Computational Physics Techniques

In this project, I implemented various numerical analysis algorithms from scratch to solve Physics and Mathematical problems, including L-U decomposition (Crout's algorithm) for Matrices, Numerical Interpolation (Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation and Cubic Splines), Fourier Transforms and solving Ordinary Differential Equations.


# Descriptions

Computational_Physics_Assignment.pdf is the assignment description.

Poon-Anson-CP202-Assignment-Report is the report where I presented the results and analysis of the algorithms.

There are two Python files in total: computational_functions.py and results.py.

computational_functions.py contains functions and methods which are also the answers or parts of the answers to question 1a, 1b, 2a, 2c, 3a, 3b and 5b. This file gives no output after running. computational_functions.py needs to be run before using results.py.

results.py contains validations of implemented functions and answers or parts of the answers to question to 1a, 1b, 2b, 2d, 2e, 3c, 4a, 4b, 5c, 5d and 5e. It is important to have run the first cell before running any other cell, which imports functions from computational_functions.py and other relevant libraries.

For each question, in results.py, it is important to run in the order of cells. After a graph is displayed, it is important that this graph is closed before displaying the next graph, to avoid overplotting. To run the validations, it is also required to run all the cells before in the same question.
