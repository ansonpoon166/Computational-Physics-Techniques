# Computational Physics Techniques

In this project, I implemented various numerical analysis algorithms from scratch to solve Physics and Mathematical problems, including L-U decomposition (Crout's algorithm) for Matrices, Numerical Interpolation (Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation and Cubic Splines), Fourier Transforms and solving Ordinary Differential Equations.

## Usage

Before running the scripts, install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the script, run the following in the terminal:
```
python results.py
```

## Descriptions

`Computational_Physics_Assignment.pdf` is the assignment description.

`Poon-Anson-CP202-Assignment-Report` is the report where I presented the results and analysis of the algorithms.

## Python Scripts

There are two Python files in total:

- `computational_functions.py` contains the implementation of all the algorithms mentioned above. This file gives no output after running. 

- `results.py` contains validations of implemented functions and answers or parts of the answers to question to 1a, 1b, 2b, 2d, 2e, 3c, 4a, 4b, 5c, 5d and 5e from `Computational_Physics_Assignment.pdf`. Graphs are also outputted after running the code.
